# Riverscout - A Distributed Environmental Monitoring System

## Overview
Riverscout was my final year project, completed as part of my studies at Waterford Institute of Technology. It focused on near real time monitoring of waterways and rivers. This README provides an overview of the API apecification and code structure.
#### Tools + Tech used

This project was created by the [oas-generator](https://github.com/isa-group/oas-generator) and modified to suit the needs. 

### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [oas-tools](https://github.com/isa-group/oas-tools) middleware which does most of the work.
